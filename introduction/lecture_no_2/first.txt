Topic Name : Order of growth

An important order ☺️

c < log(log n) < log(n) < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 < 2^n < n^n

Find the order of growth of following mathmetical functions

1:  F(n) = c(log n) + k(2) + 9  , Where c and k are constant
2:  G(n) = v(n) + log(log n) * 3 + c  , Where v and c and constant


Answer : 
1 -> log(n)
2 -> n

Important Note : A higher order growth functions always slower with compare to other.
